# Implement_ImageQuilting_Matlab
It's a implementation of paper "Image Quilting" by AA Efros

I just done the image synthesis part of paper.

This paper try to find a new way to synthesize texture by a way 
that to seperate an image to n overlap part,
and combinate them into a bigger image then.

There are three part of this:

1.Image Cropping

2.Sum Square Difference Algorithm

3.Finding best path with smallest error between subimages.
